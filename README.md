## Using this

- Install VirtualBox (and in Vagrant, a 64-bit Ubuntu box as your base box. Will fix this req. soon)
- Clone this repo

Then, in the directory:

	bundle
	librarian-chef install
	vagrant up 
	
It took my MacBook Air about 37 minutes to build everything.

## TODO

A lot. This is just a first draft. Haven't touched OpenCV or any of that. But it has the base stack. More to come.
